Welcome to my website!  I began developing this website September 9th, 2018 in order to improve my
understanding of web-design and better prepare myself for Advanced Web-design and Programming, an
elective taught at the University of Montana by Michael Cassens.  This website uses bootstrap, and c.s.s.
to render the layout. Buttons rely on jQuery (a JavaScript library) to perform their assigned functions.
